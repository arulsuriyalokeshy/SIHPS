## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
combines practicality with educational value and incentivization, making it a potentially effective solution to the e-waste problem.


## Proposed Solution 
1.Website Development: Develop a user-friendly website with a searchable database of e-waste collection and recycling facilities. Users should be able to input their location or use geolocation services to find the nearest facilities.<br>
2.Device Model Input: Include an option for users to input the model of their old devices. This could be done through a search bar or dropdown menu. Users can then receive information about the specific components of their devices and how they should be disposed of properly.<br>
3.Credit Points System: Implement a credit points system where users earn points based on the amount of precious metals recovered from their devices when disposed of correctly. The website can provide estimates of the value of these metals, and users can accumulate points for future rewards or incentives.<br>



## Use Cases
1.Locating Nearest E-Waste Facilities<br>
2.Educational Pop-ups<br>
3.Device Model Input for Recycling Guidance<br>
4.Credit Points System<br>
5.Mobile App Integration<br>


## Technology Stack
1.Frontend Development<br>
2.Backend Development<br>
3.Geolocation Services<br>
4.User Authentication and Management<br>
5.Educational Pop-ups<br>


## Dependencies
Maps and Geolocation Services:<br>
Google Maps API or Mapbox: For geocoding user addresses, displaying maps, and plotting the locations of e-waste facilities.<br>
Geocoding API: To convert user-entered addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for mapping purposes.<br>
